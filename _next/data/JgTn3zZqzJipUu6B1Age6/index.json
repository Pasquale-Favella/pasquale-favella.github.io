With the continuous improvement of React and Next.js, new features have been introduced to enhance performance and user experience. Two such features are Lazy and Suspense.\r\n\r\n## Lazy Loading\r\n\r\nLazy loading is a technique that allows you to load components only when they are needed. This can significantly improve the initial load time of your application by reducing the size of the initial JavaScript bundle.\r\n\r\nIn React, you can use the `React.lazy` function to create a lazy-loaded component. The `React.lazy` function takes a function that returns a dynamic import. This means you can use dynamic imports to load the component's module only when it's required.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';\r\n\r\nconst LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\r\n        <LazyComponent />\r\n      </Suspense>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn the code above, the `LazyComponent` is imported lazily using `React.lazy`. The `Suspense` component is used to wrap the lazy component and specify a fallback to display while the lazy component is being loaded. The fallback will be shown until the lazy component is fully loaded and ready to render.\r\n\r\n## Suspense for Data Fetching\r\n\r\nReact's Suspense feature goes beyond lazy loading and also allows you to handle asynchronous data fetching in a more elegant way. Before Suspense, handling asynchronous data fetching involved using various libraries and complex state management. With Suspense, you can easily handle data fetching and error handling using a more declarative approach.\r\n\r\nTo use `Suspense` for data fetching, you can use the `React.Suspense` component along with the `React.lazy` function. Here's an example of fetching data from an API and displaying it with Suspense:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';\r\n\r\nconst fetchData = () => {\r\n  return fetch('https://api.example.com/data')\r\n    .then((response) => response.json());\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst LazyComponentWithData = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponentWithData'));\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\r\n        <LazyComponentWithData data={fetchData()} />\r\n      </Suspense>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n## Error Handling with Suspense\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of using Suspense is its built-in error handling. If the lazy component or the data fetching encounters an error, Suspense will automatically catch the error and display the fallback UI.\r\n\r\nTo handle errors with Suspense, you can use the `ErrorBoundary` component provided by React:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';\r\n\r\nconst fetchData = () => {\r\n  return fetch('https://api.example.com/data')\r\n    .then((response) => response.json());\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst LazyComponentWithData = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponentWithData'));\r\n\r\nclass ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props);\r\n    this.state = { hasError: false };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {\r\n    return { hasError: true };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    if (this.state.hasError) {\r\n      return <div>Something went wrong.</div>;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return this.props.children;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <ErrorBoundary>\r\n        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\r\n          <LazyComponentWithData data={fetchData()} />\r\n        </Suspense>\r\n      </ErrorBoundary>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, we've created an `ErrorBoundary` component that catches any errors that occur within its children. If an error occurs, it will display an error message. By wrapping the `Suspense` component with the `ErrorBoundary`, you can handle errors that may happen during lazy loading or data fetching gracefully.\r\n\r\n## Using Lazy and Suspense in Next.js\r\n\r\nNext.js extends the capabilities of React by adding server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). The good news is that you can also use Lazy and Suspense in your Next.js applications to improve the performance and user experience.\r\n\r\nTo use Lazy and Suspense in Next.js, you can follow the same approach as in regular React applications. Simply use the `React.lazy` function to create lazy-loaded components and wrap them with the `React.Suspense` component for data fetching, just like we did earlier.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is one additional step you need to consider in Next.js. Since Next.js supports server-side rendering and static site generation, you need to make sure that dynamic imports are used only on the client-side to avoid any server-side conflicts.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, you can use the `dynamic` function from Next.js instead of the `React.lazy` function. The `dynamic` function allows you to specify options, such as whether the component should be loaded on the server-side or the client-side.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of using `dynamic` in Next.js:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport React, { Suspense } from 'react';\r\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic';\r\n\r\nconst DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import('./DynamicComponent'), {\r\n  loading: () => <div>Loading...</div>,\r\n  ssr: false, // Set to true if you want to load the component on the server-side\r\n});\r\n\r\nfunction NextApp() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\r\n        <DynamicComponent />\r\n      </Suspense>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, we import the `dynamic` function from Next.js and use it to load the `DynamicComponent`. We set `ssr` to `false` to ensure that the component is only loaded on the client-side.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nLazy and Suspense are powerful features introduced in React to enhance the performance and user experience of your applications. By leveraging lazy loading and Suspense for data fetching, you can significantly improve the loading time and handle asynchronous data fetching with ease. Additionally, when using Next.js, make sure to use the `dynamic` function to ensure proper handling of server-side rendering and static site generation. So, consider using Lazy and Suspense in your React and Next.js applications to take advantage of these powerful features and create faster and more efficient web applications.\r\n\r\nHappy coding!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/14/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/14/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/13","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/13/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/13/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/13/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/13","id":1808074550,"node_id":"I_kwDOIwHgl85rxQc2","number":13,"title":"Introduction to Incremental Static Generation (ISG) in Next.js","user":{"login":"Pasquale-Favella","id":62385965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzg1OTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62385965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella","html_url":"https://github.com/Pasquale-Favella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":4991782391,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIwHgl88AAAABKYiN9w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"0075ca","default":true,"description":"Improvements or additions to documentation"},{"id":5744992208,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIwHgl88AAAABVm2f0A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/labels/Next%20JS","name":"Next JS","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2023-07-17T15:51:40Z","updated_at":"2023-07-17T15:58:37Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"In the world of web development, delivering high-performance and dynamic websites is crucial for providing an exceptional user experience. Static Generation (SG) has been a go-to approach for generating static pages in Next.js, ensuring fast load times and server efficiency. However, as applications become more dynamic, maintaining up-to-date content can be challenging. That's where Incremental Static Generation (ISG) steps in, bridging the gap between static pages and real-time updates.\r\n\r\nNext.js, a popular React framework, introduces ISG as an advanced feature that takes the benefits of Static Generation and augments them with the ability to update pages at runtime. It offers developers the power to seamlessly blend pre-rendered pages with dynamic content, resulting in fast-loading websites that display the latest data.\r\n\r\n## Static Generation (SG) in Next.js\r\nStatic Generation is a feature in Next.js that allows you to pre-render pages at build time. This means that the HTML for each page is generated once and then served to clients as static files, greatly improving performance and reducing server load.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are cases where Static Generation alone may not be sufficient. For example, if you have dynamic content that frequently changes or data that needs to be fetched from an external API, static pages generated during build time won't reflect the latest data.\r\n\r\n## Enter Incremental Static Generation (ISG)\r\nIncremental Static Generation (ISG) is an advanced feature introduced in Next.js 10.2 that combines the benefits of Static Generation with the ability to update static pages at runtime. It allows you to re-generate static pages on-demand or in the background, ensuring that your website or application always displays up-to-date information.\r\n\r\n## How does ISG work?\r\nISG leverages Next.js's hybrid approach to rendering. It initially generates static pages during the build process but leaves certain parts of the page as \"unfilled\" or \"unstable.\" These unfilled parts act as placeholders for dynamic content that will be generated or updated later.\r\n\r\nWhen a user visits a page with unfilled parts, Next.js loads the static content immediately and then fetches the dynamic data in the background. Once the data is available, Next.js regenerates the page with the updated content and caches it for subsequent requests.\r\n\r\n## Benefits of ISG\r\n1. **Improved performance**: ISG allows you to have the best of both worlds by serving static content for fast initial page loads while still updating and re-rendering dynamic parts as needed. This approach strikes a balance between performance and up-to-date information.\r\n\r\n2. **Real-time data**: With ISG, you can fetch data from APIs or databases at runtime, ensuring that your pages are always displaying the latest information. This is particularly useful for frequently changing data, such as social media feeds or stock prices.\r\n\r\n3. **Lower server load**: By generating and caching static pages, ISG reduces the load on your server. It can handle more traffic and decreases the need for frequent API calls or database queries for every page request.\r\n\r\n4. **Better user experience**: ISG allows you to show meaningful content to users immediately, even if some parts are still loading. This reduces the time spent waiting for the page to load, leading to a better user experience and increased engagement.\r\n\r\n## Implementing ISG in Next.js\r\nTo illustrate how Incremental Static Generation works in Next.js, let's consider an example of a blog application.\r\n\r\nSuppose you're building a blog application with Next.js, and you want to display a list of blog posts on the homepage. The blog posts are dynamic and can change frequently, so you want to ensure that the latest posts are always displayed.\r\n\r\nTo implement ISG in Next.js for this example:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Next.js project and set up the necessary files and folder structure.\r\n\r\n2. In your pages directory, create a file called `index.js`. This will be the homepage of your blog application.\r\n\r\n3. Inside `index.js`, define a functional component called `HomePage` that will render the blog post list.\r\n\r\n4. Use the `getStaticProps` function to fetch the blog posts data during the build process. In this example, let's assume the blog posts are fetched from an API endpoint.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\n\r\nfunction HomePage({ posts }) {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <h1>Welcome to My Blog</h1>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        {posts.map((post) => (\r\n          <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>\r\n        ))}\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\r\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts');\r\n  const posts = await res.json();\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    props: {\r\n      posts,\r\n    },\r\n    revalidate: 60,\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default HomePage;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, we're using the `getStaticProps` function to fetch the blog posts data during the build process. The fetched data is passed as a prop (`posts`) to the `HomePage` component. Additionally, we set the `revalidate` option to 60 seconds, indicating that Next.js should attempt to re-generate the page and fetch updated data every 60 seconds.\r\n\r\n5. Run the Next.js development server and navigate to the homepage. You should see the list of blog posts rendered.\r\n\r\n6. If a new blog post is published after the initial build, Next.js will attempt to re-generate the page and fetch the latest blog posts after the revalidation interval (60 seconds in this example).\r\n\r\n7. When a user visits the homepage again after the revalidation interval, Next.js will serve the previously generated static page. However, in the background, Next.js will make an API request to fetch the latest blog posts.\r\n\r\n8. Once the API request is complete, Next.js will re-render the `HomePage` component with the updated data and cache it for subsequent requests.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing ISG in this example, you ensure that the blog post list on the homepage remains up-to-date while still providing the benefits of static page generation for improved performance.\r\n\r\nRemember to customize the example to suit your specific needs, such as integrating with your own API or database to fetch the blog posts data.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\nIncremental Static Generation (ISG) is a powerful feature in Next.js that combines the benefits of Static Generation with the ability to update static pages at runtime. It allows you to have fast-loading, pre-rendered pages while still delivering real-time data to users. By implementing ISG, you can achieve better performance, improved user experience, and reduced server load. Next.js continues to innovate and provide developers with the tools they need to build modern, scalable web applications.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/13/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/13/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/12","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/12/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/12/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/12/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/12","id":1774157007,"node_id":"I_kwDOIwHgl85pv3zP","number":12,"title":"Decoding useLayoutEffect vs. useEffect","user":{"login":"Pasquale-Favella","id":62385965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzg1OTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62385965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella","html_url":"https://github.com/Pasquale-Favella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":4991782391,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIwHgl88AAAABKYiN9w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"0075ca","default":true,"description":"Improvements or additions to documentation"},{"id":5011911244,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIwHgl88AAAABKruyTA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/labels/React","name":"React","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5012912803,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIwHgl88AAAABKsr6ow","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/labels/Hooks","name":"Hooks","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2023-06-26T07:50:09Z","updated_at":"2023-06-26T07:50:09Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, provides developers with a range of powerful tools and hooks to manage state, handle side effects, and perform other critical tasks. Two commonly used hooks in React are `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`. While they may seem similar at first glance, they have distinct differences that developers should be aware of in order to use them effectively.\r\n\r\n## Purpose of the Hooks\r\n\r\nBoth `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect` allow you to perform side effects in your React components. Side effects typically include tasks such as fetching data from an API, manipulating the DOM, subscribing to events, or cleaning up resources. The main difference between the two hooks lies in the timing of when they are executed.\r\n\r\n### `useEffect`\r\n\r\n`useEffect` is a hook that is executed after the rendering is complete and the browser has painted the screen. It's a post-rendering hook that ensures the side effect is performed asynchronously, without blocking the rendering process. This makes it suitable for most scenarios, as it doesn't interfere with the user interface updates and helps maintain a smooth user experience.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of using `useEffect` to fetch data asynchronously:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\r\n\r\nconst ExampleComponent = () => {\r\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    // Fetch data asynchronously\r\n    fetchData()\r\n      .then((response) => setData(response))\r\n      .catch((error) => console.error(error));\r\n  }, []);\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <p>Data: {data}</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Mock fetch data function\r\nconst fetchData = () => {\r\n  return new Promise((resolve) => {\r\n    setTimeout(() => {\r\n      resolve('Mock Data');\r\n    }, 2000);\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, the `useEffect` hook is used to fetch data asynchronously. It runs once when the component mounts, thanks to the empty dependency array `[]`. The fetched data is stored in the `data` state using the `setData` function. This way, the component renders initially without any data and updates once the asynchronous data fetching is complete.\r\n\r\n### `useLayoutEffect`\r\n\r\n`useLayoutEffect` is similar to `useEffect` in that it allows you to perform side effects. However, it is executed synchronously, immediately after the rendering phase, but before the browser has painted the screen. This means that the side effect performed inside `useLayoutEffect` will block the painting and layout of the UI until it is finished. Consequently, using `useLayoutEffect` can lead to performance issues and should be used with caution.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of using `useLayoutEffect` to measure an element's dimensions synchronously:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport React, { useState, useLayoutEffect } from 'react';\r\n\r\nconst ExampleComponent = () => {\r\n  const [dimensions, setDimensions] = useState({ width: 0, height: 0 });\r\n\r\n  useLayoutEffect(() => {\r\n    // Measure element dimensions synchronously\r\n    const element = document.getElementById('myElement');\r\n    const { width, height } = element.getBoundingClientRect();\r\n    setDimensions({ width, height });\r\n  }, []);\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <div id=\"myElement\">Example Element</div>\r\n      <p>Dimensions: {dimensions.width} x {dimensions.height}</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, the `useLayoutEffect` hook is used to measure the dimensions of the element with the ID `myElement`. It runs once when the component mounts, as indicated by the empty dependency array `[]`. The dimensions are obtained synchronously using `getBoundingClientRect()`, and the width and height values are stored in the `dimensions` state using the `setDimensions` function. This ensures that the latest DOM layout data is available for further calculations or rendering.\r\n\r\n## Choosing the Right Hook\r\n\r\nIt's important to choose the appropriate hook based on your specific requirements. Here's a summary of the differences between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`:\r\n\r\n1. Timing: `useEffect` is executed asynchronously after the rendering and painting phase, while `useLayoutEffect` is executed synchronously before the painting phase.\r\n2. Blocking: `useEffect` doesn't block the rendering or painting process, whereas `useLayoutEffect` can introduce delays as it blocks the UI updates until the side effect is complete.\r\n3. Use cases: `useEffect` is suitable for most scenarios where you need to perform side effects, while `useLayoutEffect` is more appropriate when you need to read or manipulate the DOM immediately after a component update.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, using `useEffect` will be sufficient for handling side effects in React components. It ensures a smooth user experience by performing asynchronous side effects after rendering. However, when you require synchronous access to the DOM layout, `useLayoutEffect` can be a valuable tool.\r\n\r\nRemember to use `useLayoutEffect` judiciously, as it can potentially impact performance by blocking rendering. Only utilize it when you genuinely need to read or manipulate the DOM layout synchronously.\r\n\r\nBy understanding the differences between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`, you can make informed decisions and write more efficient and performant React components that fulfill your specific requirements.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/12/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/12/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}],"projects":[{"id":421885911,"node_id":"R_kgDOGSV31w","name":"Knowledgeable","full_name":"Pasquale-Favella/Knowledgeable","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Pasquale-Favella","id":62385965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzg1OTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62385965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella","html_url":"https://github.com/Pasquale-Favella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Pasquale-Favella/Knowledgeable","description":"Beautiful
