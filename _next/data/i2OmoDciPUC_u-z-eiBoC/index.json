One way to achieve this is by using the View-Model (VM) pattern, where the VM acts as an intermediary between the UI and the data layer.\r\n\r\nIn this article, we'll explore how to use the VM pattern with the `combineLatest` operator in Angular to efficiently manage complex UI interactions.\r\n\r\n## The VM Pattern\r\n\r\nThe VM pattern is a design pattern that separates the concerns of the UI and the data layer. The VM acts as a mediator between the two layers, handling data requests and updates on behalf of the UI.\r\n\r\nIn Angular, the VM is typically implemented as a component class that contains the UI state and logic. The VM class interacts with the data layer through services and provides data to the UI through observables.\r\n\r\nOne of the key benefits of using the VM pattern is that it enables developers to decouple the UI from the data layer, making it easier to test and maintain the codebase.\r\n\r\n## Using combineLatest\r\n\r\nThe `combineLatest` operator is a powerful tool in the RxJS library that enables developers to combine multiple observables into a single observable. This can be especially useful in the context of the VM pattern, where multiple data streams need to be combined to update the UI state.\r\n\r\nConsider a scenario where we have a component that displays a list of posts for a selected user. To implement this functionality using the VM pattern, we would create a VM class that contains two observables: one for the selected user and one for the posts.\r\n\r\nWe can use the `combineLatest` operator to combine these two observables into a single observable that emits the posts for the selected user. Here's an example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { combineLatest, Observable } from 'rxjs';\r\nimport { map } from 'rxjs/operators';\r\nimport { Post } from './post';\r\nimport { PostService } from './post.service';\r\nimport { User } from './user';\r\nimport { UserService } from './user.service';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-post-list',\r\n  template: `\r\n    <h2>Posts by {{ selectedUser?.name }}</h2>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li *ngFor=\"let post of posts$ | async\">\r\n        {{ post.title }}\r\n      </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  `\r\n})\r\nexport class PostListComponent implements OnInit {\r\n  selectedUser: User | undefined;\r\n  posts$: Observable<Post[]> | undefined;\r\n\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private userService: UserService,\r\n    private postService: PostService\r\n  ) {}\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    // Combine the selected user and posts observables using combineLatest\r\n    this.posts$ = combineLatest([\r\n      this.userService.selectedUser$,\r\n      this.postService.posts$\r\n    ]).pipe(\r\n      // Map the combined observables to only return posts by the selected user\r\n      map(([selectedUser, posts]) =>\r\n        selectedUser ? posts.filter(post => post.userId === selectedUser.id) : []\r\n      )\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  onSelectUser(user: User) {\r\n    // Set the selected user\r\n    this.userService.setSelectedUser(user);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn this example, we have a `PostListComponent` that displays a list of posts for a selected user.\r\n\r\nThe `ngOnInit` method of the component sets up the `posts$` observable by combining the `selectedUser$` observable from the `UserService` and the `posts$` observable from the `PostService` using `combineLatest`. The `map` operator is used to filter the posts to only include those by the selected user.\r\n\r\nThe `onSelectUser` method is used to update the selected user in the `UserService`.\r\n\r\nBy using `combineLatest` in this way, we are able to efficiently manage complex UI interactions while maintaining a separation of concerns between the UI and the data layer.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nIn this article, we explored how to use the VM pattern with the `combineLatest` operator in Angular to efficiently manage complex UI interactions. By decoupling the UI from the data layer and using reactive programming techniques, we can create more maintainable and testable codebases.\r\n\r\nAs with any design pattern or library, it's important to use these tools in a way that makes sense for your specific application. By understanding the principles behind the VM pattern and `combineLatest`, we can make informed decisions about when and how to use them in our own projects.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/10/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/10/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/9","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/9/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/9/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/9/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/9","id":1591979011,"node_id":"I_kwDOIwHgl85e46wD","number":9,"title":"Spring Mongo JPA - the basics","user":{"login":"Pasquale-Favella","id":62385965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzg1OTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62385965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella","html_url":"https://github.com/Pasquale-Favella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":4991782391,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIwHgl88AAAABKYiN9w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"0075ca","default":true,"description":"Improvements or additions to documentation"},{"id":5176884231,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIwHgl88AAAABNJD8Bw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/labels/Java","name":"Java","color":"57627E","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5176887291,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIwHgl88AAAABNJEH-w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/labels/Spring%20Boot","name":"Spring Boot","color":"10AE3D","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2023-02-20T14:33:56Z","updated_at":"2023-02-20T14:58:25Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Mongo JPA, or the Java Persistence API, is a powerful tool that allows developers to interact with MongoDB databases using the standard JPA interface. JPA is a specification for object-relational mapping in Java, which means that it allows developers to map Java classes to database tables and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on those tables using standard Java methods.\r\n\r\nMongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that is widely used in modern web applications due to its flexibility and scalability. With the rise of microservices architecture, many developers are turning to MongoDB as a preferred database solution. However, working with MongoDB can be challenging for developers who are not familiar with NoSQL concepts and query languages.\r\n\r\nThat's where Mongo JPA comes in. It provides a simple and intuitive way to work with MongoDB databases, allowing developers to focus on their business logic rather than database implementation details. By using Mongo JPA, developers can take advantage of the powerful features of MongoDB, such as schemaless data modeling, dynamic queries, and horizontal scaling.\r\n\r\nOne of the key benefits of using Mongo JPA is that it provides a consistent API for working with different types of databases, including relational databases and NoSQL databases. This means that developers can use the same Java code to interact with MongoDB and other databases, which can simplify their codebase and reduce the learning curve for new developers.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of using Mongo JPA is that it supports the JPA Criteria API, which allows developers to create type-safe queries using Java code. This can help prevent errors and make code easier to maintain, especially for larger projects. Additionally, Mongo JPA supports advanced query features such as aggregation, sorting, and pagination, which can be challenging to implement using raw MongoDB queries.\r\n\r\nTo use Mongo JPA, developers can add the necessary dependencies to their project and create entity classes that map to MongoDB collections. They can then use standard JPA methods to interact with the database, such as `find` , `persist` , `merge` , and `remove`. Mongo JPA also provides annotations that can be used to define indexes, map embedded objects, and specify other database-related details.\r\nHere an example\r\n``` java\r\n@Entity\r\npublic class User {\r\n    \r\n    @Id\r\n    private String id;\r\n    \r\n    @Column(name = \"username\")\r\n    private String username;\r\n    \r\n    @Column(name = \"password\")\r\n    private String password;\r\n    \r\n    @Embedded\r\n    private Address address;\r\n    \r\n    // Getters and setters\r\n    \r\n    public String getId() {\r\n        return id;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public void setId(String id) {\r\n        this.id = id;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public String getUsername() {\r\n        return username;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public void setUsername(String username) {\r\n        this.username = username;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public String getPassword() {\r\n        return password;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public void setPassword(String password) {\r\n        this.password = password;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public Address getAddress() {\r\n        return address;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public void setAddress(Address address) {\r\n        this.address = address;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    // Embedded class\r\n    \r\n    @Embeddable\r\n    public static class Address {\r\n        \r\n        @Column(name = \"street\")\r\n        private String street;\r\n        \r\n        @Column(name = \"city\")\r\n        private String city;\r\n        \r\n        @Column(name = \"state\")\r\n        private String state;\r\n        \r\n        @Column(name = \"zip\")\r\n        private String zip;\r\n        \r\n        // Getters and setters\r\n        \r\n        public String getStreet() {\r\n            return street;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        public void setStreet(String street) {\r\n            this.street = street;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        public String getCity() {\r\n            return city;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        public void setCity(String city) {\r\n            this.city = city;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        public String getState() {\r\n            return state;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        public void setState(String state) {\r\n            this.state = state;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        public String getZip() {\r\n            return zip;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        public void setZip(String zip) {\r\n            this.zip = zip;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn this example, the `User` class is annotated with `@Entity`, which tells Mongo JPA that it should be mapped to a MongoDB collection. The `@Id` annotation is used to indicate that the `id` field is the primary key for the collection. The `@Column` annotation is used to specify the names of the fields in the collection.\r\nThe `Address` class is embedded in the `User` class using the `@Embedded` annotation. It is also annotated with `@Embeddable`, which indicates that it should be stored as part of the `User` document in the MongoDB collection.\r\n\r\nThe class above can be used to build a `MongoRepository`\r\n``` java\r\n@Repository\r\npublic interface UserRepository extends MongoRepository<User, String> {\r\n    \r\n    User findByUsername(String username);\r\n    \r\n    List<User> findByAddressCity(String city);\r\n    \r\n    @Query(\"{ 'address.state' : ?0 }\")\r\n    List<User> findByAddressState(String state);\r\n    \r\n    List<User> findByAddressStateAndAddressCity(String state, String city);\r\n    \r\n    default List<User> findUsersByCriteria(String state, String city) {\r\n        Criteria criteria = new Criteria();\r\n        \r\n        if (state != null && !state.isEmpty()) {\r\n            criteria = criteria.and(\"address.state\").is(state);\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        if (city != null && !city.isEmpty()) {\r\n            criteria = criteria.and(\"address.city\").is(city);\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        Query query = new Query(criteria);\r\n        return mongoTemplate.find(query, User.class);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn this example, the `findUsersByCriteria` method is a custom query that uses `Criteria` to build a dynamic query. `Criteria` is a flexible way to build complex queries with conditions that can change at runtime.\r\nThe method takes two parameters, `state` and `city`, which are used to build the `Criteria` object. The method first creates a new `Criteria` object and then adds conditions based on the values of `state` and `city`. If the `state` parameter is not null and not empty, it adds a condition to match the `state` field in the `address` object. If the `city` parameter is not null and not empty, it adds a condition to match the `city` field in the `address` object.\r\nFinally, the method creates a new `Query` object with the `Criteria` object and uses `MongoTemplate` to execute the query and return a list of `User` objects.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Mongo JPA is a valuable tool for developers who want to work with MongoDB databases using standard Java methods. It provides a consistent and intuitive API that can simplify code and reduce the learning curve for new developers. By leveraging the powerful features of MongoDB, developers can build scalable and flexible applications that can meet the demands of modern web development.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/9/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/9/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/8","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/8/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/8/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/8/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/8","id":1560080092,"node_id":"I_kwDOIwHgl85c_O7c","number":8,"title":"React with RXJS","user":{"login":"Pasquale-Favella","id":62385965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzg1OTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62385965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella","html_url":"https://github.com/Pasquale-Favella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":4991782391,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIwHgl88AAAABKYiN9w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"0075ca","default":true,"description":"Improvements or additions to documentation"},{"id":5011911244,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIwHgl88AAAABKruyTA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/labels/React","name":"React","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5012942463,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIwHgl88AAAABKstufw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/labels/Rxjs","name":"Rxjs","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2023-01-27T16:49:00Z","updated_at":"2023-01-27T17:10:08Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Reactive programming is a programming paradigm that deals with data streams and the propagation of change. Reactive eXtensions for JavaScript (RxJS) is a library for reactive programming using observables in JavaScript. It can be used with React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to handle asynchronous data and user interactions in a more efficient and elegant way.\r\n\r\nIn this article, we will explore how to use RxJS with React to handle asynchronous data and user interactions.\r\n\r\nFirst, let's understand what observables are. An observable is a stream of data that can be observed and acted upon. It is similar to a promise, but it can emit multiple values over time. An observer is an object that subscribes to an observable and receives notifications when the observable emits values.\r\n\r\nTo use RxJS with React, we first need to install it using npm or yarn:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install rxjs\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```\r\nyarn add rxjs\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, we can create an observable in a React component using the `of` method from the `rxjs` library. This method creates an observable that emits a single value. For example, we can create an observable that emits the current date and time every second:\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nimport { of, interval } from 'rxjs';\r\nimport { useEffect, useState } from 'react';\r\n\r\nconst Clock = () => {\r\n  const [time, setTime] = useState(new Date());\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    const subscription = of(new Date())\r\n      .pipe(interval(1000))\r\n      .subscribe(time => setTime(time));\r\n    return () => {\r\n      subscription.unsubscribe();\r\n    }\r\n  }, []);\r\n  return <div>{time.toString()}</div>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, we use the `interval` operator from the `rxjs/operators` library to emit the current date and time every second. We also subscribe to the observable in the `useEffect` hook method and unsubscribe from it in the `useEffect` clean up function to prevent memory leaks.\r\n\r\nWe can also use observables to handle user interactions in React. For example, we can create an observable that emits events from a text input and use the `map` operator to transform the events into the current value of the input:\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nimport { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';\r\nimport { map } from 'rxjs/operators';\r\nimport { useEffect, useState, useRef } from 'react';\r\n\r\nconst SearchInput = () => {\r\n  const [value, setValue] = useState('');\r\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    const subscription = fromEvent(inputRef.current, 'input')\r\n      .pipe(map(event => event.target.value))\r\n      .subscribe(value => setValue(value));\r\n    return () => {\r\n      subscription.unsubscribe();\r\n    }\r\n  }, []);\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <input ref={inputRef} />\r\n      <div>{value}</div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nuse the `map` operator to transform the events into the current value of the input and update the component's state accordingly.\r\n\r\nAnother useful operator for handling user interactions is the `debounceTime` operator. This operator delays the emission of values from an observable for a specified amount of time. This can be useful for implementing a search feature, for example, where we only want to perform the search after the user has stopped typing for a certain amount of time.\r\n``` js\r\nimport { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';\r\nimport { map, debounceTime } from 'rxjs/operators';\r\nimport { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';\r\nimport axios from 'axios';\r\n\r\nconst SearchInput = () => {\r\n  const inputRef = useRef(null);\r\n  const [searchResults, setSearchResults] = useState([]);\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    const subscription = fromEvent(inputRef.current, 'input')\r\n      .pipe(\r\n        map(event => event.target.value),\r\n        debounceTime(500)\r\n      )\r\n      .subscribe(value => search(value));\r\n    return () => {\r\n      subscription.unsubscribe();\r\n    }\r\n  }, []);\r\n\r\n  const search = async (value) => {\r\n    try {\r\n      const response = await axios.get(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?title_like=${value}`);\r\n      setSearchResults(response.data);\r\n    } catch (error) {\r\n      console.error(error);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <input ref={inputRef} />\r\n      <div>\r\n        {searchResults.map(result => <div key={result.id}>{result.title}</div>)}\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, we use the `debounceTime` operator to delay the emission of values from the input event observable by 500 milliseconds. This means that the search function will only be called when the user stops typing for half a second.\r\n\r\nRxJS also allows us to compose multiple observables together using operators like `merge`, `concat`, and `zip`. This can be useful for handling multiple asynchronous data sources or user interactions in a single component.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, RxJS is a powerful library for reactive programming in JavaScript and can be used with React to handle asynchronous data and user interactions in a more efficient and elegant way. It provides a wide range of operators for transforming, filtering, and composing observables, making it a valuable tool for building complex and responsive user interfaces.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/8/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/8/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/5","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/5/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/5/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/5/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/5","id":1535204735,"node_id":"I_kwDOIwHgl85bgV1_","number":5,"title":"NGRX vs RXJS","user":{"login":"Pasquale-Favella","id":62385965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzg1OTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62385965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella","html_url":"https://github.com/Pasquale-Favella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":4991782391,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIwHgl88AAAABKYiN9w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"0075ca","default":true,"description":"Improvements or additions to documentation"},{"id":5011828087,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIwHgl88AAAABKrptdw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/labels/Angular","name":"Angular","color":"F85A56","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5012942463,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIwHgl88AAAABKstufw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/labels/Rxjs","name":"Rxjs","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2023-01-16T16:28:43Z","updated_at":"2023-01-16T17:08:04Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"NGRX is a popular library for managing the state of an Angular application. It is built on top of the RxJS library and uses the principles of reactive programming to make it easier to handle complex state management tasks.\r\n\r\nOne of the main advantages of NGRX over plain RxJS is that it provides a consistent and well-structured way to manage the state of an application. With NGRX, the state of the application is managed in a centralized store, which makes it easy to keep track of all the state changes and handle them in a predictable way.\r\n\r\nNGRX also provides a set of powerful tools for managing the state of an application, such as actions, reducers, and effects. Actions are used to describe the changes to the state, reducers are used to update the state based on the actions, and effects are used to handle side-effects, such as making an API call or navigating to a different page.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of NGRX is that it is designed to work seamlessly with Angular. It uses Angular's change detection mechanism to automatically update the view when the state changes, and it also integrates with Angular's dependency injection system, which makes it easy to manage the state throughout the application.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, NGRX provides a set of powerful tools for debugging, testing, and performance optimization, such as the ability to log state changes, time-travel debugging, and memoized selectors.\r\n\r\nUsing plain RxJS:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { BehaviorSubject } from 'rxjs';\r\n\r\nconst counterSubject = new BehaviorSubject(0);\r\n\r\nfunction increment() {\r\n  const currentCount = counterSubject.getValue();\r\n  counterSubject.next(currentCount + 1);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction decrement() {\r\n  const currentCount = counterSubject.getValue();\r\n  counterSubject.next(currentCount - 1);\r\n}\r\n\r\ncounterSubject.subscribe(count => {\r\n  console.log(count);\r\n});\r\n```\r\nIn this example, a BehaviorSubject is used to manage the state of the counter. The BehaviorSubject is initialized with an initial value of 0. The increment and decrement functions are used to update the state by calling the next method on the BehaviorSubject and passing the new count.\r\n\r\nThe subscribe method is used to subscribe to the counterSubject and log the current count to the console whenever it changes.\r\n\r\nUsing NGRX:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { StoreModule, Store } from '@ngrx/store';\r\nimport { counterReducer } from './counter.reducer';\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  imports: [\r\n    StoreModule.forRoot({ count: counterReducer })\r\n  ]\r\n})\r\nexport class AppModule { }\r\n\r\nexport const increment = createAction('[Counter] Increment');\r\nexport const decrement = createAction('[Counter] Decrement');\r\n\r\n@Injectable()\r\nexport class CounterService {\r\n  count$ = this.store.pipe(select('count'));\r\n\r\n  constructor(private store: Store) { }\r\n\r\n  increment() {\r\n    this.store.dispatch(increment());\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  decrement() {\r\n    this.store.dispatch(decrement());\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn this example, NGRX is used to manage the state of the counter. The StoreModule is imported from the @ngrx/store library and configured with a root reducer that handles the counter state.\r\n\r\nActions are defined using the createAction method, increment and decrement actions are used to update the state. The store is injected into a service, which has a count$ property that selects the count from the store and makes it available for subscription.\r\n\r\nThe increment and decrement methods dispatch the corresponding actions to the store, which causes the state to update.\r\n\r\nWith this example, you can see that NGRX provides a more structured way to manage the state of an application. It enforces a clear separation of concerns between the state, the actions that update the state, and the reducers that handle the actions. It also provides a powerful set of tools for debugging, testing, and performance optimization, such as the ability to log state changes, time-travel debugging, and memoized selectors.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, NGRX provides a built-in mechanism for handling async actions with the help of the @Effect decorator, which makes it easy to handle and manage async code in your application.\r\n\r\nIn summary, NGRX provides a powerful and well-structured way to manage the state of an Angular application, and it provides a set of powerful tools for managing complex state management tasks.
