One common requirement in enterprise applications is the need to work with multiple data sources. This could be due to various reasons, such as handling different databases, connecting to external services, or segregating data for performance and security purposes. In this article, we will explore how to set up and manage multiple data sources in a Spring Boot application.\r\n\r\n## 1. Why Use Multiple Data Sources?\r\n\r\nBefore diving into the technical details, it's essential to understand why you might need multiple data sources in a Spring Boot application:\r\n\r\n- **Data Isolation**: Separate data sources can be used to isolate sensitive data from the main application database. For example, you may store user credentials in a separate database for added security.\r\n\r\n- **Performance Optimization**: By segregating data, you can optimize the performance of your application. For instance, storing frequently accessed data in a dedicated database can improve response times.\r\n\r\n- **Integration with External Services**: You might need to connect to external services or databases that are not part of your main application database.\r\n\r\n- **Legacy Systems**: In enterprise environments, you may need to interact with legacy systems that use different data sources.\r\n\r\n## 2. Configuration and Dependency Setup\r\n\r\nTo set up multiple data sources in a Spring Boot application, you need to follow these steps:\r\n\r\n### 2.1. Adding Dependencies\r\n\r\nIn your `pom.xml` file, include the necessary dependencies:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<!-- Spring Boot Starter -->\r\n<dependency>\r\n    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter</artifactId>\r\n</dependency>\r\n\r\n<!-- Spring Data JPA for the primary data source -->\r\n<dependency>\r\n    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>\r\n</dependency>\r\n\r\n<!-- HikariCP for connection pooling -->\r\n<dependency>\r\n    <groupId>com.zaxxer</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>HikariCP</artifactId>\r\n</dependency>\r\n\r\n<!-- JDBC driver for your primary database -->\r\n<dependency>\r\n    <groupId>com.mysql.cj</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>\r\n</dependency>\r\n\r\n<!-- Additional dependencies for secondary data sources -->\r\n<!-- Add dependencies for secondary databases here -->\r\n```\r\nEnsure you include the JDBC driver for your primary database and any additional dependencies required for your secondary data sources.\r\n\r\n### 2.2. Creating Configuration Properties\r\n\r\nCreate configuration properties for your data sources in `application.properties` or `application.yml`. Define properties for the primary and secondary data sources, such as URL, username, password, and driver class. For example:\r\n\r\n```properties\r\n# Primary DataSource\r\nspring.datasource.primary.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/primary_db\r\nspring.datasource.primary.username=root\r\nspring.datasource.primary.password=root\r\nspring.datasource.primary.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver\r\n\r\n# Secondary DataSource\r\nspring.datasource.secondary.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/secondary_db\r\nspring.datasource.secondary.username=root\r\nspring.datasource.secondary.password=root\r\nspring.datasource.secondary.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 3. Configuring Multiple Data Sources\r\n\r\nIn this section, we will configure multiple data sources and create beans for them.\r\n\r\n### 3.1. Defining Data Source Beans\r\n\r\nIn your Spring Boot application, define multiple `DataSource` beans in a configuration class. For example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Configuration\r\n@EnableTransactionManagement\r\npublic class DataSourceConfig {\r\n\r\n    @Primary\r\n    @Bean(name = \"primaryDataSource\")\r\n    @ConfigurationProperties(prefix = \"spring.datasource.primary\")\r\n    public DataSource primaryDataSource() {\r\n        return DataSourceBuilder.create().build();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Bean(name = \"secondaryDataSource\")\r\n    @ConfigurationProperties(prefix = \"spring.datasource.secondary\")\r\n    public DataSource secondaryDataSource() {\r\n        return DataSourceBuilder.create().build();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the code above, we use `@ConfigurationProperties` to bind the properties from `application.properties` to the respective `DataSource` beans.\r\n\r\n### 3.2. Creating JdbcTemplate Beans\r\n\r\nTo interact with the databases, create `JdbcTemplate` beans for each data source. These `JdbcTemplate` beans are responsible for executing SQL queries.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Configuration\r\npublic class JdbcTemplateConfig {\r\n\r\n    @Primary\r\n    @Bean(name = \"primaryJdbcTemplate\")\r\n    public JdbcTemplate primaryJdbcTemplate(@Qualifier(\"primaryDataSource\") DataSource dataSource) {\r\n        return new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Bean(name = \"secondaryJdbcTemplate\")\r\n    public JdbcTemplate secondaryJdbcTemplate(@Qualifier(\"secondaryDataSource\") DataSource dataSource) {\r\n        return new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 4. Implementing Repository and Service Layers\r\n\r\nNow that you have configured multiple data sources, you can create repository and service layers to interact with each data source independently.\r\n\r\n### 4.1. Creating Entity Classes\r\n\r\nDefine entity classes for each data source. These classes represent the database tables and their relationships. Annotate them with `@Entity` and define the appropriate mappings.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Entity\r\n@Table(name = \"primary_table\")\r\npublic class PrimaryEntity {\r\n    // Define entity properties and relationships\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Entity\r\n@Table(name = \"secondary_table\")\r\npublic class SecondaryEntity {\r\n    // Define entity properties and relationships\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4.2. Building Repository Interfaces\r\n\r\nCreate repository interfaces for each entity using Spring Data JPA. These interfaces will provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic interface PrimaryRepository extends JpaRepository<PrimaryEntity, Long> {\r\n    // Define custom query methods if needed\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic interface SecondaryRepository extends JpaRepository<SecondaryEntity, Long> {\r\n    // Define custom query methods if needed\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4.3. Developing Service Classes\r\n\r\nBuild service classes that encapsulate business logic and interact with the repositories. These services will use the respective `JdbcTemplate`  beans to execute queries on the correct data source.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Service\r\npublic class PrimaryService {\r\n\r\n    private final JdbcTemplate primaryJdbcTemplate;\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    public PrimaryService(@Qualifier(\"primaryJdbcTemplate\") JdbcTemplate primaryJdbcTemplate) {\r\n        this.primaryJdbcTemplate = primaryJdbcTemplate;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Implement service methods using primaryJdbcTemplate\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Service\r\npublic class SecondaryService {\r\n\r\n    private final JdbcTemplate secondaryJdbcTemplate;\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    public SecondaryService(@Qualifier(\"secondaryJdbcTemplate\") JdbcTemplate secondaryJdbcTemplate) {\r\n        this.secondaryJdbcTemplate = secondaryJdbcTemplate;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Implement service methods using secondaryJdbcTemplate\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 5. Transaction Management\r\n\r\nWhen working with multiple data sources, it's crucial to manage transactions correctly. Spring Boot provides transaction management capabilities that you can leverage.\r\n\r\n### 5.1. Configuring Transaction Managers\r\n\r\nConfigure transaction managers for each data source in your configuration class:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Configuration\r\n@EnableTransactionManagement\r\npublic class TransactionManagerConfig {\r\n\r\n    @Primary\r\n    @Bean(name = \"primaryTransactionManager\")\r\n    public PlatformTransactionManager primaryTransactionManager(\r\n            @Qualifier(\"primaryDataSource\") DataSource primaryDataSource) {\r\n        return new DataSourceTransactionManager(primaryDataSource);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Bean(name = \"secondaryTransactionManager\")\r\n    public PlatformTransactionManager secondaryTransactionManager(\r\n            @Qualifier(\"secondaryDataSource\") DataSource secondaryDataSource) {\r\n        return new DataSourceTransactionManager(secondaryDataSource);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the code above, we define `PlatformTransactionManager` beans for both data sources.\r\n\r\n### 5.2. Transactional Annotations\r\n\r\nUse the `@Transactional` annotation to specify transaction boundaries in your service methods. You can indicate which transaction manager to use for each method.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Service\r\npublic class PrimaryService {\r\n\r\n    private final JdbcTemplate primaryJdbcTemplate;\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    public PrimaryService(@Qualifier(\"primaryJdbcTemplate\") JdbcTemplate primaryJdbcTemplate) {\r\n        this.primaryJdbcTemplate = primaryJdbcTemplate;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Transactional(transactionManager = \"primaryTransactionManager\")\r\n    public void performPrimaryDataOperation() {\r\n        // Perform database operations using primaryJdbcTemplate\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Service\r\npublic class SecondaryService {\r\n\r\n    private final JdbcTemplate secondaryJdbcTemplate;\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    public SecondaryService(@Qualifier(\"secondaryJdbcTemplate\") JdbcTemplate secondaryJdbcTemplate) {\r\n        this.secondaryJdbcTemplate = secondaryJdbcTemplate;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Transactional(transactionManager = \"secondaryTransactionManager\")\r\n    public void performSecondaryDataOperation() {\r\n        // Perform database operations using secondaryJdbcTemplate\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy specifying the `transactionManager` attribute in the `@Transactional` annotation, you ensure that each method operates within the correct transaction context.\r\n\r\n## 6. Testing Multiple Data Sources\r\n\r\nTo ensure the reliability and correctness of your multiple data source setup, you need to create comprehensive tests.\r\n\r\n### 6.1. Unit Testing\r\n\r\nFor unit testing, you can use tools like JUnit and Mockito to mock the data source interactions. Create test cases for your service methods and validate their behavior.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)\r\npublic class PrimaryServiceTest {\r\n\r\n    @InjectMocks\r\n    private PrimaryService primaryService;\r\n\r\n    @Mock\r\n    private JdbcTemplate primaryJdbcTemplate;\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void testPerformPrimaryDataOperation() {\r\n        // Mock database interaction and test the service method\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)\r\npublic class SecondaryServiceTest {\r\n\r\n    @InjectMocks\r\n    private SecondaryService secondaryService;\r\n\r\n    @Mock\r\n    private JdbcTemplate secondaryJdbcTemplate;\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void testPerformSecondaryDataOperation() {\r\n        // Mock database interaction and test the service method\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 6.2. Integration Testing\r\n\r\nFor integration testing, you can use Spring's `@SpringBootTest` annotation to create test configurations that mimic your production environment. You can also use an embedded database like H2 for testing.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@SpringBootTest\r\npublic class MultipleDataSourceIntegrationTest {\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    private PrimaryService primaryService;\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    private SecondaryService secondaryService;\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void testMultipleDataSources() {\r\n        // Write integration tests to validate interactions between services\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 7. Conclusion\r\nSetting up and managing multiple data sources in a Spring Boot application can be a challenging but necessary task for many enterprise applications. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can achieve data isolation, optimize performance, and integrate seamlessly with various data sources.\r\n\r\nRemember to configure the necessary dependencies, create and configure data source beans and JdbcTemplate beans, implement repository and service layers, and manage transactions correctly. Comprehensive unit and integration testing are crucial to ensure the reliability and correctness of your multiple data source setup.\r\n\r\nWith the right design and careful implementation, Spring Boot makes it possible to work with multiple data sources efficiently, enabling you to build robust and scalable applications that meet the complex data requirements of modern enterprise systems.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/15/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/15/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/14","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/14/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/14/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/14/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/14","id":1830660798,"node_id":"I_kwDOIwHgl85tHaq-","number":14,"title":"Using Lazy and Suspense in React.js and Next.js","user":{"login":"Pasquale-Favella","id":62385965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzg1OTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62385965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella","html_url":"https://github.com/Pasquale-Favella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":4991782391,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIwHgl88AAAABKYiN9w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"0075ca","default":true,"description":"Improvements or additions to documentation"},{"id":5011911244,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIwHgl88AAAABKruyTA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/labels/React","name":"React","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5744992208,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIwHgl88AAAABVm2f0A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/labels/Next%20JS","name":"Next JS","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2023-08-01T07:43:38Z","updated_at":"2023-08-01T08:01:19Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Next is a powerful framework built on top of React, designed for server-side rendering and static site generation. With the continuous improvement of React and Next, new features have been introduced to enhance performance and user experience. Two such features are Lazy and Suspense.\r\n\r\n## Lazy Loading\r\n\r\nLazy loading is a technique that allows you to load components only when they are needed. This can significantly improve the initial load time of your application by reducing the size of the initial JavaScript bundle.\r\n\r\nIn React, you can use the `React.lazy` function to create a lazy-loaded component. The `React.lazy` function takes a function that returns a dynamic import. This means you can use dynamic imports to load the component's module only when it's required.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';\r\n\r\nconst LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\r\n        <LazyComponent />\r\n      </Suspense>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn the code above, the `LazyComponent` is imported lazily using `React.lazy`. The `Suspense` component is used to wrap the lazy component and specify a fallback to display while the lazy component is being loaded. The fallback will be shown until the lazy component is fully loaded and ready to render.\r\n\r\n## Suspense for Data Fetching\r\n\r\nReact's Suspense feature goes beyond lazy loading and also allows you to handle asynchronous data fetching in a more elegant way. Before Suspense, handling asynchronous data fetching involved using various libraries and complex state management. With Suspense, you can easily handle data fetching and error handling using a more declarative approach.\r\n\r\nTo use `Suspense` for data fetching, you can use the `React.Suspense` component along with the `React.lazy` function. Here's an example of fetching data from an API and displaying it with Suspense:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';\r\n\r\nconst fetchData = () => {\r\n  return fetch('https://api.example.com/data')\r\n    .then((response) => response.json());\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst LazyComponentWithData = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponentWithData'));\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\r\n        <LazyComponentWithData data={fetchData()} />\r\n      </Suspense>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n## Error Handling with Suspense\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of using Suspense is its built-in error handling. If the lazy component or the data fetching encounters an error, Suspense will automatically catch the error and display the fallback UI.\r\n\r\nTo handle errors with Suspense, you can use the `ErrorBoundary` component provided by React:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';\r\n\r\nconst fetchData = () => {\r\n  return fetch('https://api.example.com/data')\r\n    .then((response) => response.json());\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst LazyComponentWithData = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponentWithData'));\r\n\r\nclass ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props);\r\n    this.state = { hasError: false };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {\r\n    return { hasError: true };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    if (this.state.hasError) {\r\n      return <div>Something went wrong.</div>;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return this.props.children;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <ErrorBoundary>\r\n        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\r\n          <LazyComponentWithData data={fetchData()} />\r\n        </Suspense>\r\n      </ErrorBoundary>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, we've created an `ErrorBoundary` component that catches any errors that occur within its children. If an error occurs, it will display an error message. By wrapping the `Suspense` component with the `ErrorBoundary`, you can handle errors that may happen during lazy loading or data fetching gracefully.\r\n\r\n## Using Lazy and Suspense in Next.js\r\n\r\nNext.js extends the capabilities of React by adding server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). The good news is that you can also use Lazy and Suspense in your Next.js applications to improve the performance and user experience.\r\n\r\nTo use Lazy and Suspense in Next.js, you can follow the same approach as in regular React applications. Simply use the `React.lazy` function to create lazy-loaded components and wrap them with the `React.Suspense` component for data fetching, just like we did earlier.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is one additional step you need to consider in Next.js. Since Next.js supports server-side rendering and static site generation, you need to make sure that dynamic imports are used only on the client-side to avoid any server-side conflicts.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, you can use the `dynamic` function from Next.js instead of the `React.lazy` function. The `dynamic` function allows you to specify options, such as whether the component should be loaded on the server-side or the client-side.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of using `dynamic` in Next.js:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport React, { Suspense } from 'react';\r\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic';\r\n\r\nconst DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import('./DynamicComponent'), {\r\n  loading: () => <div>Loading...</div>,\r\n  ssr: false, // Set to true if you want to load the component on the server-side\r\n});\r\n\r\nfunction NextApp() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\r\n        <DynamicComponent />\r\n      </Suspense>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, we import the `dynamic` function from Next.js and use it to load the `DynamicComponent`. We set `ssr` to `false` to ensure that the component is only loaded on the client-side.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nLazy and Suspense are powerful features introduced in React to enhance the performance and user experience of your applications. By leveraging lazy loading and Suspense for data fetching, you can significantly improve the loading time and handle asynchronous data fetching with ease. Additionally, when using Next.js, make sure to use the `dynamic` function to ensure proper handling of server-side rendering and static site generation. So, consider using Lazy and Suspense in your React and Next.js applications to take advantage of these powerful features and create faster and more efficient web applications.\r\n\r\nHappy coding!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/14/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/14/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/13","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/13/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/13/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/13/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/13","id":1808074550,"node_id":"I_kwDOIwHgl85rxQc2","number":13,"title":"Introduction to Incremental Static Generation (ISG) in Next.js","user":{"login":"Pasquale-Favella","id":62385965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzg1OTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62385965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella","html_url":"https://github.com/Pasquale-Favella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":4991782391,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIwHgl88AAAABKYiN9w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"0075ca","default":true,"description":"Improvements or additions to documentation"},{"id":5744992208,"node_id":"LA_kwDOIwHgl88AAAABVm2f0A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/labels/Next%20JS","name":"Next JS","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2023-07-17T15:51:40Z","updated_at":"2023-08-01T08:02:01Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"OWNER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"In the world of web development, delivering high-performance and dynamic websites is crucial for providing an exceptional user experience. Static Generation (SG) has been a go-to approach for generating static pages in Next.js, ensuring fast load times and server efficiency. However, as applications become more dynamic, maintaining up-to-date content can be challenging. That's where Incremental Static Generation (ISG) steps in, bridging the gap between static pages and real-time updates.\r\n\r\nNext.js, a popular React framework, introduces ISG as an advanced feature that takes the benefits of Static Generation and augments them with the ability to update pages at runtime. It offers developers the power to seamlessly blend pre-rendered pages with dynamic content, resulting in fast-loading websites that display the latest data.\r\n\r\n## Static Generation (SG) in Next.js\r\nStatic Generation is a feature in Next.js that allows you to pre-render pages at build time. This means that the HTML for each page is generated once and then served to clients as static files, greatly improving performance and reducing server load.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are cases where Static Generation alone may not be sufficient. For example, if you have dynamic content that frequently changes or data that needs to be fetched from an external API, static pages generated during build time won't reflect the latest data.\r\n\r\n## Enter Incremental Static Generation (ISG)\r\nIncremental Static Generation (ISG) is an advanced feature introduced in Next.js 10.2 that combines the benefits of Static Generation with the ability to update static pages at runtime. It allows you to re-generate static pages on-demand or in the background, ensuring that your website or application always displays up-to-date information.\r\n\r\n## How does ISG work?\r\nISG leverages Next.js's hybrid approach to rendering. It initially generates static pages during the build process but leaves certain parts of the page as \"unfilled\" or \"unstable.\" These unfilled parts act as placeholders for dynamic content that will be generated or updated later.\r\n\r\nWhen a user visits a page with unfilled parts, Next.js loads the static content immediately and then fetches the dynamic data in the background. Once the data is available, Next.js regenerates the page with the updated content and caches it for subsequent requests.\r\n\r\n## Benefits of ISG\r\n1. **Improved performance**: ISG allows you to have the best of both worlds by serving static content for fast initial page loads while still updating and re-rendering dynamic parts as needed. This approach strikes a balance between performance and up-to-date information.\r\n\r\n2. **Real-time data**: With ISG, you can fetch data from APIs or databases at runtime, ensuring that your pages are always displaying the latest information. This is particularly useful for frequently changing data, such as social media feeds or stock prices.\r\n\r\n3. **Lower server load**: By generating and caching static pages, ISG reduces the load on your server. It can handle more traffic and decreases the need for frequent API calls or database queries for every page request.\r\n\r\n4. **Better user experience**: ISG allows you to show meaningful content to users immediately, even if some parts are still loading. This reduces the time spent waiting for the page to load, leading to a better user experience and increased engagement.\r\n\r\n## Implementing ISG in Next.js\r\nTo illustrate how Incremental Static Generation works in Next.js, let's consider an example of a blog application.\r\n\r\nSuppose you're building a blog application with Next.js, and you want to display a list of blog posts on the homepage. The blog posts are dynamic and can change frequently, so you want to ensure that the latest posts are always displayed.\r\n\r\nTo implement ISG in Next.js for this example:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Next.js project and set up the necessary files and folder structure.\r\n\r\n2. In your pages directory, create a file called `index.js`. This will be the homepage of your blog application.\r\n\r\n3. Inside `index.js`, define a functional component called `HomePage` that will render the blog post list.\r\n\r\n4. Use the `getStaticProps` function to fetch the blog posts data during the build process. In this example, let's assume the blog posts are fetched from an API endpoint.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\n\r\nfunction HomePage({ posts }) {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <h1>Welcome to My Blog</h1>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        {posts.map((post) => (\r\n          <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>\r\n        ))}\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\r\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts');\r\n  const posts = await res.json();\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    props: {\r\n      posts,\r\n    },\r\n    revalidate: 60,\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default HomePage;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, we're using the `getStaticProps` function to fetch the blog posts data during the build process. The fetched data is passed as a prop (`posts`) to the `HomePage` component. Additionally, we set the `revalidate` option to 60 seconds, indicating that Next.js should attempt to re-generate the page and fetch updated data every 60 seconds.\r\n\r\n5. Run the Next.js development server and navigate to the homepage. You should see the list of blog posts rendered.\r\n\r\n6. If a new blog post is published after the initial build, Next.js will attempt to re-generate the page and fetch the latest blog posts after the revalidation interval (60 seconds in this example).\r\n\r\n7. When a user visits the homepage again after the revalidation interval, Next.js will serve the previously generated static page. However, in the background, Next.js will make an API request to fetch the latest blog posts.\r\n\r\n8. Once the API request is complete, Next.js will re-render the `HomePage` component with the updated data and cache it for subsequent requests.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing ISG in this example, you ensure that the blog post list on the homepage remains up-to-date while still providing the benefits of static page generation for improved performance.\r\n\r\nRemember to customize the example to suit your specific needs, such as integrating with your own API or database to fetch the blog posts data.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\nIncremental Static Generation (ISG) is a powerful feature in Next.js that combines the benefits of Static Generation with the ability to update static pages at runtime. It allows you to have fast-loading, pre-rendered pages while still delivering real-time data to users. By implementing ISG, you can achieve better performance, improved user experience, and reduced server load. Next.js continues to innovate and provide developers with the tools they need to build modern, scalable web applications.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/13/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pasquale-Favella/pasquale-favella.github.io/issues/13/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}],"projects":[{"id":421885911,"node_id":"R_kgDOGSV31w","name":"Knowledgeable","full_name":"Pasquale-Favella/Knowledgeable","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Pasquale-Favella","id":62385965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzg1OTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62385965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella","html_url":"https://github.com/Pasquale-Favella","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pasquale-Favella/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Pasquale-Favella/Knowledgeable","description":"Beautiful
