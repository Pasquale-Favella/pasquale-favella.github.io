This project is a beautiful portfolio and blog that uses the GitHub API as a CMS. It's a great way to showcase your work and share your thoughts with the world.

**Personalization:** You can personalize this project by modifying the `@/config/owner.ts` file. By configuring the owner, your public GitHub projects will be automatically showcased in the portfolio.

**Writing Articles:** Articles can be written as **closed** GitHub issues with the label **documentation**. Any other labels added to the issue will automatically become tags for the articles.
